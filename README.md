 ### User Stories

 Throughout the project I used the GitHub projects board to log all user stories as my project management tool. This helped me keep focus on the necesarry tasks as I would move them to the "in progress lane" as I'm working on the story. I would then move them to the "done" lane once the story has been completed.
